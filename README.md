# Wallet-Check-API
The Wallet-Check API was built with Node.js and acts as a back end web service for the angular front-end server. It has one endpoint that takes in a company name and returns the companies top-10 aliases with all donations made as well as their donations and positions towards bills in Congress.

# Instructions
After cloning the repo make sure to enter the root directory where the app.js is and run 'npm install'. This will install all of the dependencies in the package.json.
Then to start the API run 'node app' and go to localhost:3000/api/:orgName and see what your org has spent their money on in politics!
